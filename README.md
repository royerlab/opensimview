## Description:

One of the primary challenges of light-sheet microscopy is that it is difficult to achieve high-resolution images of larger, more optically challenging specimens, such as entire embryos, due to mismatches between the illuminating light-sheet and the focal plane of the detection objective. The microscope addresses this challenge by integrating a computational method that optimizes spatial resolution across the specimen volume in real time.

The microscope has several advantages. First, it can adapt to spatiotemporal dynamics of genetically encoded fluorescent markers. Second, it can robustly optimize imaging performance during large-scale morphogenetic changes in living organisms. Third, it can recover cellular and sub-cellular structures in many regions that are not resolved by non-adaptive imaging. Fourth, it is capable of long-term adaptive imaging of entire developing zebrafish and Drosophila embryos, as well as adaptive whole-brain functional imaging in larval zebrafish.

In summary, the adaptive light-sheet microscope is a powerful tool for live imaging of biological specimens that offers excellent spatial and temporal resolution and facilitates long-term observation of biological processes under physiological conditions.
